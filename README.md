## 30 days of react

This repo contains the entire source and content for the article series of [30 days of React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react) hosted by the Fullstack.io team.

## How to use this repository

The repository contains all the sources for the article series where each day is separated out by branch. For instance, the day-1 branch is contained in the `day-1` branch.

Each day is separated by folder and each has their own `project.json`. This makes it incredibly easy to manage different projects from day-to-day.

## What's in it?

Every day contains a full react application, following the same procedure used to create the article series. Every day can be run using the same basic steps. For the days that require a bit more work, check out the tutorial series on the blog.

The steps to use a day from the 30 days of React project are:

1. Install the dependenciees
2. Run the project

We can run these steps using the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Since all of the days are built using the fantastic [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool, all of the commands are available from that project in every day.
