  can easily develop and deploy our applications.

The React team noticed that there is a lot of configuration required (and the community helped bloat -- us included) to run a React app. Luckily, some smart folks in the React team/community got together and built/released an official generator app that makes it much easier to get up and running quickly.

## Packaging

So far in this course, we've only been working with writing our components in a single script. Although it's great for simplicity, it can be difficult to share components amongst multiple developers. A single file is also pretty difficult to write complex applications.

Instead, we'll set up a build tool for our applications using a very popular packaging tool called [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The tool provides a great place to start out developing our applications without needing to spend too much time working on setting up our build tooling.

In order to use it, we'll need to start out by installing it. We can use `npm` or `yarn` to install `create-react-app`:

## create-react-app

The [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project is released through Facebook helps us get up and running quickly with a React app on our system with no custom configuring required on our part.

The package is released as a [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) and can be installed using `npm`.

> ### A plug for `nvm` and `n`
>
> The [Node](https://nodejs.org) homepage has simple documentation on how to install node, if you don't already have it installed on your system.
>
> We recommend using the [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or the [n](https://github.com/tj/n) version management tools. These tools make it incredibly easy to install/use multiple versions of node on your system at any point.

With `node` installed on our system, we can install the `create-react-app` package:

```bash
npm install --global create-react-app
```

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/install-create-react-app.jpg" />

With `create-react-app` installed globally, we'll be able to use the `create-react-app` command anywhere in our terminal.

Let's create a new app we'll call 30days using the `create-react-app` command we just installed. Open a Terminal window in a directory where you want to create your app.

In terminal, we can create a new React application using the command and adding a name to the app we want to create.

```bash
create-react-app 30days && cd 30days
```

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/create-app.jpg" />

Let's start our app in the browser. The `create-react-app` package comes with a few built-in scripts it created for us (in the `package.json` file). We can _start_ editing our app using the built-in webserver using the `npm start` command:

```bash
npm start
```

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/npm-start.jpg" />

This command will open a window in Chrome to the default app it created for us running at the url: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/chrome-start.jpg" />

Let's edit the newly created app. Looking at the directory structure it created, we'll see we have a basic node app running with a `public/index.html` and a few files in the `src/` directory that comprise our running app.

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/tree.jpg" />

Let's open up the `src/App.js` file and we'll see we have a very basic component that should all look familiar. It has a simple render function which returns the result we see in the Chrome window.

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/app.jpg" />

The `index.html` file has a single `<div />` node with the id of `#root`, where the app itself will be mounted for us automatically (this is handled in the `src/index.js` file). Anytime we want to add webfonts, style tags, etc. we can load them in the `index.html` file.

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/index-html.jpg" />

Let's look at a few of the features `create-react-app` enables for us.

We've used multiple components in the past. Let's pull in the example we walked through on day-4 with a header and content (slightly simplified -- changing the className from `notificationsFrame` to `App` and removing the inner component):

```javascript
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We _could_ define the `Header` and the `Content` component in the same file, but as we discussed, that becomes pretty cumbersome. Instead, let's create a directory called `components/` in the `src/` directory (`src/components/`) and create two files called `Header.js` and `Content.js` in there:

```bash
# in my-app/
mkdir src/components
touch src/components/{Header,Content}.js
```

Now, let's write the two components in their respective file. First, the `Header` component in `src/components/Header.js`:

```javascript
import React from "react";

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="header">
        <h1>Header</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

And now let's write the `Content` component in the `src/components/Content.js` file:

```javascript
import React from "react";

class Content extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p className="App-intro">Content goes here</p>;
  }
}
```

By making a small update to these two component definitions, we can then `import` them into our `App` component (in `src/App.js`).

We'll use the `export` keyword before the `class` definition:

Let's update the `Header` component slightly:

```javascript
export class Header extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
```

and the `Content` component:

```javascript
export class Content extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
```

Now we can `import` these two component from our `src/App.js` file. Let's update our `App.js` by adding these two `import` statements:

```javascript
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "./components/Header";
import { Content } from "./components/Content";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Here, we're using _named_ exports to pull in the two components from their respective files in `src/components/`.

By convention, if we only have a single export from these files, we can use the `export default` syntax so we can remove the `{}` surrounding the named export. Let's update each of these respective files to include an extra line at the end to enable the default import:

```javascript
export class Header extends React.Component {
  // ...
}

export default Header;
```

and the `Content` component:

```javascript
export class Content extends React.Component {
  // ...
}

export default Content;
```

Now we can update our import of the two components like so:

```javascript
import React from "react";

import Header from "./components/Header";
import Content from "./components/Content";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Using this knowledge, we can now also update our components by importing the named `Component` class and simplify our definition of the class file again. Let's take the `Content` component in `src/components/Content.js`:

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react'; // This is the change

export class Content extends Component { // and this allows us
                                         // to not call React.Component
                                         // but instead use just
                                         // the Component class
  render() {
    return <p className="App-intro">Content goes here</p>;
  }
}

export default Content;
```

## Shipping

We'll get to deployment in a few weeks, but for the time being know that the generator created a build command so we can create minified, optimize versions of our app that we can upload to a server.

We can build our app using the `npm run build` command in the root of our project:

```bash
npm run build
```

<img class="wide" src="/assets/series/30-days-of-react/images/12/build.jpg" />

With that, we now have a live-reloading single-page app (SPA) ready for development. Tomorrow, we'll use this new app we built diving into rendering multiple components at run-time.
