Over the next 30 days, you'll get a good feel for the various parts of the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) web framework and its ecosystem.

Each day in our 30 day adventure will build upon the previous day's materials, so by the end of the series, you'll not only know the terms, concepts, and underpinnings of how the framework works, but be able to use React in your next web application.

Let's get started. We'll start [at the very beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RW3nDRmu6k) as it's a very good place to start.

## What is React?

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web applications.

At the heart of all React applications are **components**. As their name suggests, React components are small self-contained pieces of web application. Components can be as small as a button, or an individual input field on the page.

Components are building blocks of an application, but they are also building blocks for other, larger components. For example - previous examples of button or input components can be a part of larger form component.

Process of building apps in React is writing React components to build up our interface. Similar to collecting pieces to complete a puzzle. Smaller components like buttons and input fields combine to make larger components, like forms.

React web application is nothing but a component tree made up of components like forms, made up of even smaller components themselves. 

Importantly, each component in a React app abides by strict data management principles. Complex, interactive user interfaces often involve complex data and application state. The surface area of React is limited and aimed at giving us the tools to be able to anticipate how our application will look with a given set of circumstances. We dig into these principles later in the course.

## Okay, so how do we use it?

React is a JavaScript framework. Using the framework is as simple as including a JavaScript file in our HTML and using the `React` exports in our application's JavaScript.

For instance, the _Hello world_ example of a React website can be as simple as:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Hello world</title>
  <!-- Script tags including React -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.3.1/react.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.3.1/react-dom.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script type="text/babel">
    ReactDOM.render(
      <h1>Hello world</h1>,
      document.querySelector('#app')
    );
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

<div id="demo1"></div>

Although it might look a little scary, the JavaScript code is a single line that dynamically adds _Hello world_ to the page. Note that we only needed to include a handful of JavaScript files to get everything working.

## How does it work?

Unlike many of its predecessors, React operates not directly on the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) immediately, but on a **virtual DOM**. That is, rather than manipulating the `document` in a browser after changes to our data (which can be quite slow) it resolves changes on a DOM built and run entirely in memory. After the virtual DOM has been updated, React intelligently determines what changes to make to the actual browser's DOM.

The [React Virtual DOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-differences.html) exists entirely in-memory and is a representation of the web browser's DOM. Because of this, when we write a React component, we're not writing directly to the DOM, but we're writing a virtual component that React will turn into the DOM.

In the next article, we'll look at what this means for us as we build our React components and jump into JSX and writing our first real components.
